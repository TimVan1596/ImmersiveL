# ImmersiveL

ImmersiveL is a framework and models hub for connecting languages all over the world open and free.

Now, ImmersiveL app is a translation framework based on Deepspeed. The primary structure is found within the `app` directory, composed of a Python 3.8 environment with Flask, Deepspeed, and PyTorch.

**The first model for now are trained on a bloomz model, its license could be found at [here](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/blog/the-bigscience-rail-license). The Apache License are licensed to the derived part of the model and other source code file in this repo.**

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   After cloning, move to the `app` directory. Then, install all the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

   ```bash
   cd ImmersiveL/app
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model**

   The models can be found at [this Huggingface link](https://huggingface.co/funstoryai/immersiveL-exp/tree/main). Download the files under the "Files and versions" section and place them into the `app/model` directory.

4. **Run the Application**

   Start the application using Deepspeed with the following command:

   ```bash
   deepspeed --num_gpus 1 app.py
   ```

    Once you see a message similar to * Running on [IP Address], it indicates that the application has successfully started.

## Using ImmersiveL

Once the application is up and running, you can easily use the provided translation endpoints.

### Example 1: Translating from Chinese to English

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Ê¨ßÊ¥≤ÁªèÊµéÂ¢ûÈïø‰ªçÈù¢‰∏¥ËæÉÂ§ßÊåëÊàò", "task": "zh2en"}' http://localhost:7000/translate
```

### Example 2: Translating from English to Chinese

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Want to live longer? Play with your grandkids. It‚Äôs good for them, too.", "task": "en2zh"}' http://localhost:7000/translate
```
